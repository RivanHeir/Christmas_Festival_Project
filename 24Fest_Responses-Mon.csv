If that makes sense. Also having more well-known hymns like Angels we have Heard on High as the processional or recessional works better for memorization, cause having Hark for last year’s recessional was fantastic.
Also, I know it’s a little insane for everyone, but I really think going back to the old on-campus fest arrangement of two solos for all the other choirs and an intermission would really add a bit more fun to contrast with going to Orch Hall and doing the one solo per non-ole choir. It was a drag to do two solo pieces when I was in Viking freshman year but it was worth it, and now that I’m in Chapel and a much better singer, I really wish we could’ve done two solo pieces.",B,S+,,,,,,A,Humanities,,,"I know there are so many S+ but this was just such a goated fest. Also, this might be bragging since I’m in Chapel (though I have also heard it from a lot of people who weren’t in Chapel last year), but I Will Make A Way might be one of the best fest songs in current student body memory.
