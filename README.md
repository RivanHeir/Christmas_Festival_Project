# Christmas_Festival_Project
Final project for Analyzing Politics class (Fall 2023).

For this assignment, I conducted a survey of fellow St. Olaf Christmas Festival participants, and examined what factors affect how well a song was liked. This was gauged by having the respondent rank each song into a "tier", from **F** (the lowest) to **S+** (the highest). I came up with several hypotheses and tested each of these, by translating the tier response into an integer scale.

Later, in the fall of 2024, I updated the survey to account for the 2024 Christmas Festival songs, and sent out the survey again. Although I produced updated summaries and charts from this, I did not create another deliverable document. I completed this assignment independently.

## Deliverable

The deliverable for this project was _Analyzing_Politics_Final_Project.pdf_, created using LaTeX. 

## Documents Summary

- _Fest_Survey_Project.Rmd_ was the main document for all of my work in 2023.
- _24_Fest_Survey_Project.Rmd_ contains the work I did in the 2024 update.
- _Fest151.csv_ contains the survey data for the 2023 project.
- _24Fest_Responses-Xmas_Break.csv_ contains the updated 2024 data.
- _SongVariables-tent.csv_ contains the hand-compiled metadata about the 2023 songs.
- _SongVariables24.csv_ contains hand-compiled data about the 2024 songs.

The song metadata was joined to the survey data to enable analysis and testing of my hypotheses.

## Packages

The final product was created in the Overleaf LaTeX compiler. The surveys were sent out as Google Forms to the St. Olaf music ensembles, and then transferred from Google Sheets to RStudio. All other work was done in RStudio, using packages _tidyverse_ and _lme4_. 

## AI and Reproduction

Generative AI was used for a small part of the coding, but for none of the writing of the final report.
