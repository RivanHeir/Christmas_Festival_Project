# Christmas_Festival_Project
Final project for Analyzing Politics class (Fall 2023).

For this assigment, I conducted a survey of fellow St. Olaf Christmas Festival participants, and examined what factors affect the regard in which various songs were held, ranked in "tiers" from "F" to "S+". I came up with several hypotheses and tested each of these. Later, in the fall of 2024, I updated the survey to account for the 2024 Christmas Festival songs, and sent out the survey again. Though I produced updated summaries and charts from this, I did not create another deliverable document. I completed this assignment by myself.

## Deliverable

The deliverable for this project was _Analyzing_Politics_Final_Project.pdf_, created on LaTeX. 

## Documents Summary

_Fest_Survey_Project.Rmd_ was the main document for all of my work in 2023; the update in 2024 was done on _24_Fest_Survey_Project.Rmd_. 

_Fest151.csv_ contains the survey data for the 2023 project; _24Fest_Responses-Xmas_Break.csv_ contains the updated 2024 data.

_SongVariables-tent.csv_ and _SongVariables24.csv_ contain hand-compiled data about the various songs, from 2023 and 2024 respectively. This was joined to the survey data to enable analysis and testing of my hypotheses.

## Packages

The final product was created in the Overleaf LaTeX compiler. The surveys were sent out as Google Forms to the St. Olaf music ensembles, and then transferred from Google Sheets to RStudio. All other work was done in RStudio, using packages _tidyverse_ and _lme4_. 

Generative AI was used for a small part of the coding, but for none of the writing of the final report.
